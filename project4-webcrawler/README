challenges:

high-level approach:

while the visitorder:
  send a GET request from visitorder[0]
  when we recv a new message:
  1. split message into 2 parts (header and body)
  2. parse header, record status codes and new location(if 300)
  3. parse body:
    a. if 200, put current link into visited and put all not recorded link into visitorder list.
        <1> if a key in this page, record this key.
        <2> if we got 5 keys, exit
    b. if 300, put current link into visited and put new location into visitorder list.
    c. if 400, do nothing
    d. if 500, put current link into visitorder list

keep loop while the visitorder is not empty, until the program got 10 keys.

parse approach:
  when the program recv a new message, it would keep tracking "<a herf =" in this message 
  and record the text between "<a herf =" and "a/ >".
