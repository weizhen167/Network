challenges:

we faced 2 challenges during this project.

1. the cookie format. We tried a lot of cookie format to match the login form.
2. chunked message. The end line of chunked message is really annoying,
we choose to create a socket when we try to send the message,
and close this socket when we received responds
3. VPN. some times we got alot of 400 error wen we use vpn out of campus, 
this would cause we can not getting the web addresses that on these bad 
pages. So there was possible that we lost some of keys pages. But, it's 
rearely happend on the ccis machine. so we tink that's because the bad VPN,not our code.


high-level approach:

while the visitorder:
  send a GET request from visitorder[0]
  when we recv a new message:
  1. split message into 2 parts (header and body)
  2. parse header, record status codes and new location(if 300)
  3. parse body:
    a. if 200, put current link into visited and put all not recorded link into visitorder list.
        <1> if a key in this page, record this key.
        <2> if we got 5 keys, exit
    b. if 300, put current link into visited and put new location into visitorder list.
    c. if 400, do nothing
    d. if 500, put current link into visitorder list

keep loop while the visitorder is not empty, until we got 5 keys.

parse approach:
  when we recv a new message, we keep tracking "<a herf =" in this message 
  and record the text between "<a herf =" and "a/ >".
